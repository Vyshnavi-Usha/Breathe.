# Breathe.

Shedding light on invisible pollution

Welcome to “Breathe.” an innovative solution for a healthier urban environment. Designed to change the way we perceive and proactively manage air quality in our 
areas. Our world is experiencing a worsening climate crisis, with increasing levels of pollution everyday. Particle pollution is largely invisible, allowing people and influential businesses to ignore its effects on the health and wellness of a population. 

- Problem statement- No. 3- Environmental Sustainability (NIT Pragyan)

- Focus Area- Leveraging Real-Time Machine Learning for Pollution Reduction and Maximizing Environmental Impact + Predictive Air Quality Management: Using real-time ML predictions to preemptively address air pollution spikes.

Novelty
Existing systems: Applications mostly give information about pollutant levels.
They are also scattered between websites and various other sources. 

1. We attempt to create an application to raise awareness about the alarming 
increased levels of pollutants, by providing their real time values.

2. It will indicate their toxicity level, and lets people know what they are, how are 
they produced, what measures can be taken to control or reduce them.

3. Finally it also gives measures to protect people from pollutants and provides 
suggestions to increase air quality in their environment.

Flow of Application:
https://data.gov.in/catalog/real-time-air-quality-index
(Look up the available cities as mentioned in the government website (changes everyday) because real-time API generation is rare, since the website is under maintanence.)
- Upon entering the city location, click submit.
- View the pollutants level, what causes their production, what are their harmful effects & how to reduce them.
